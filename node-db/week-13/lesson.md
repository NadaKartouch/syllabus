## What is a server?

Servers are computer programs that receive requests from other programs, the
_clients_ and send back a response e.g share data, information or hardware and
software resources.

### ...and what is a server in plain English?

A server is a computer program. Its job is to send and receive data.

Let's take a website for example. A website is just a collection of HTML and CSS
files, images, maybe some javascript files. When you type a website address in
your browser's address bar, the browser (client) sends a **request** to the
server that lives at that address. The browser asks the server to give it the
files it needs to display the website properly.

## Node and its ecosystem

> [Node.jsÂ®](https://nodejs.org/en/) is a **JavaScript runtime** built on
> Chrome's **V8 JavaScript engine**. Node.js uses an **event-driven**,
> **non-blocking** I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient.

## What is it used for?

* web servers, so creating dynamic websites
* set up a local web development environment
* easier to build desktop applications with Electron: Slack, Visual Code, Atom
* some of the biggest companies use Node.js in production: Netflix, Walmart,
  IBM, etc.
* JavaScript everywhere (used to be PHP, Python, JavaScript, MySQL, Apache, now
  JavaScript full stack)

## A simple Node.js server

### Simple server\*\*

```js
const http = require("http");

const server = http.createServer(function(req, res) {
  res.end("Hello World!");
});

server.listen(5000);

console.log("Node.js web server at port 5000 is running..");
```

## HTTP

> It is a protocol that browser and the server uses to talk to each other

## Express

[Express](http://expressjs.com/) is one of the most widely-used frameworks for
Node.js. It simplifies base features of Node.js, making it easier and faster to
build your application's backend. Learning Express gives you a great foundation
for becoming a Node.js developer.

# APIs

APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) provide a way for applications to
communicate with each other. We already consumed an API earlier in the day:
**Github API**. We managed to _communicate_ with Github and get important
information. We - the client - can use this information in a number of different
ways. Our client, in this case, is a Web page but it could have easily been a
Mobile Application, or a TV setbox etc...

> **Let's** watch this video about APIs -
> [What is an API](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7wmiS2mSXY)

> **Exercise**: Let's expose the `posts.json` as an API for other clients to
> consume through the url `/api/get-posts`. Hint: make use `res.sendFile`

## REST API

[REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) (REpresentational State Transfer) and RESTful APIs provide a convention and architecture for building APIs that is simple and scalable.

There are many constraints and aspects to building a REST API, but one
fundamental constraint is the use of a URL (Uniform Resource Locator) and HTTP
Methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE etc..)

In our _endpoint_ that we just created `/api/get-posts`, the _get_ part of the
URL is redundant as the HTTP Method `GET` already tells that we are _GETting_ a
_Resource_. The Resource in this case is called **posts**.

> Exercise: Let's rename our endpoint to `/posts` so that it follows RESTful
> architecture.
>
> **What would the endpoint for creating posts be called?**

> **Watch**: [What is a REST API](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YcW25PHnAA)
> (up to 3 minutes)

REST is a big topic that we will revisit again. The table below from Wikipedia
shows how a typical RESTful API would look like.

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer#Uniform_interface)

For now, remember when building APIs, to use **Resource** names to identify your
endpoints and make use of the **HTTP methods (Verbs)** to describe operations
performed on those resources.

## Workshop

Buckle up and start the [API workshop](./api-workshop.md).

## Group Research Topics

* Security: (https, same origin, cookies, xss etc..)
* Performance: Request lifecycle (from browser to server and back), Performance
  considerations and optimisations
* HTTP and REST: (headers, status codes, Cookies, REST)
* Node internals: Node event loop, Node core modules, async/sync (non-blocking
  operations)
